# city-groups

Efforts by some freeCodeCamp students focused on representing data about city groups (formerly campsites) as a collective project started at the Gitter's Data Science Room.

# observations

* This sub-folder includes visualizations (2D and 3D), scrapers to mine platforms such as Facebook, GoogleMaps or relevant urls, and some analytics.
* Technologies include D3.js, THREE.js, node.js.
* In some cases data became deprecated or not existent; an example is the freeCodeCamp project known as the Wiki, which was target of one of the scrapers when residing in Github, but changed substantially after moving to the freeCodeCamp forum.
