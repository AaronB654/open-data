# open-data

freeCodeCamp produces millions of records every month in separate formats. Clicking activity, chat conversations, thousands of video minutes or articles' words...

This is the repository hosting the [freeCodeCamp's Open Data initiative](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/free-code-camp-christmas-special-giving-the-gift-of-data-6ecbf0313d62) that started December 2015. The repository includes part of that data that has been collected from freeCodeCamp's platforms but also points to other similar freeCodeCamp initiatives, references, etc. The repo includes sub-folders of assignments, demos, projects and programs. In general, you will find:
* **Datasets**
* **Analyses** of those datasets
* **Demos** of projects based on the freeCodeCamp data
* **Links to External Projects** involving the freeCodeCamp data

The data can be of interest to, but not restricted to, those looking for datasets and projects about:
* Web Analytics
* Social Media Analysis
* Social Network Analysis
* Education Analytics
* Data Visualization
* Data-driven Web Development
* Bots

## List of project's folders/submodules:

> **NEW PROJECTS / DATASETS**:
>
> * **medium-fCC-data** : dataset : `fccmediumTitles - Cleaned_Data.tsv`
> * **medium-fCC-data** : dataset : `medium_titles - rawdata.tsv`
> * **google-analytics** : project and dataset : `challenges-performance-estimates`
> * **google-analytics** : dataset : `countries-fCC`
> * **database-dumps** : dataset : `dump2015/outputsample.json`


The repo is thought to be organised according to the following:
1. For small/medium datasets, files will be left in the corresponding folder of this repository; optionally the files could be uploaded in any other service of the cloud
2. For small/medium datasets related to featured projects, files will be available on freeCodeCamp repositories as well as Kaggle
3. For big datasets, full files will be available either on academictorrents or in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) (*soon*). A small sample of the file will be available in this repository as well as Kaggle for those who want to get introduced to the dataset.
