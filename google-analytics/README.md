### challenges-performance-estimates

A dataset with some calculations of the overall performance of students at the fCC challenges based on data collected from Google Analytics, with a final table organised according to the curriculum existing by the time of the collection.

This product was eventually used to re-order some challenges in the Beta Curriculum (2017).
